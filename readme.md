Are you tired of that one dice as a player or GM that always seems to give you bad luck?
Do you always use that one "lucky" dice just in case?
Then this Python library is just for you! It takes its randomness from the "atmospheric noise", courtesy of random.org

You need api-key from random.org for this library to work.
